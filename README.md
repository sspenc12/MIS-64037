Repository dedicated to coursework and projects for MIS-64037: Advanced Data Mining and Analytics.

Assignment #1:

The purpose of this assignment was to maximize profits for a company selling car seats for babies and toddlers. The tasks were to determine the optimal selling price for car seats in stores when located in a "good" shelf location, and the optimal price for selling car seats in a "bad" shelf location via data normalization, scaling, and regression. The last portion of the problem was to plot the optimal selling price at different stores with varying production costs.

Group Project #1:

The goal of this assignment was to maximize profits for a financial investment company while minimizing the risk to the company. Risk was assessed by reviewing a customer probabilty of default and potential loss given default. Opportunity was assessed by potential earning from a client via interest rate, loan amount, and life of loan. Three different scenarios were reviewed where the company had a different budget limit to cover a few potential loans to unlimited loans. Lasso regression was used to perform both variable selection and regularization. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to further reduce the number of variables in the data set. Ridge regression was used for making predicitions and random forest was used to determine the accuracy of the model via hypertuning and AUC review.

Group Project #2:

The goal of this assignment was to create a classification model that can predict employee attrition rate within a company. The data was cleaned, normalized, and scaled prior to attempting several different modeling techniques. The modeling techniques reviewed were random forest, generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The confusion matrix and AUC values were reviewed for each type of model to finalize the best model for the particular application.
